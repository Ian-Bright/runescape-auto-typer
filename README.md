# runescape-auto-typer

## Description

This is a desktop GUI application intended to be used specifically with the MMORPG game Runescape. The text effects are specific with respect to the game and will not produce the intended output inside of any other game. You are able to enter text of your choice to repeat, the time delay between typing can be in seconds or milleseconds. Listed are all the text effects allowed by Runescape's in game chat.

## Simplifying Use

The files supplied will open the GUI when one on one's local machine be it via command line or inside of an IDE. To simplify things even further you can follow this link to learn how to store the program inside of a JAR file and run it once the file is opened: https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~scottm/cs307/handouts/Eclipse%20Help/jarInEclipse.htm

This description is how to do so inside of the Eclipse IDE but general purpose instructions via other methods exist elsewhere.
